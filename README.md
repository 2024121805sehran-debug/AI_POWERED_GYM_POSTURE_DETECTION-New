🏋️ AI Powered Gym Posture Detection



AI-powered real-time gym posture detection system that uses computer vision to detect body landmarks, identify exercises, and classify posture as \*\*Correct/Wrong\*\* with injury-risk feedback. The system streams a skeleton-overlay camera feed to a web dashboard and logs posture events in Firebase Firestore.

🚀 Features

- Live pose detection with \*\*MediaPipe Pose\*\* (33 landmarks)

- Real-time posture status: ✅ Correct / ❌ Wrong

- Auto exercise detection:

&nbsp; - Squat

&nbsp; - Deadlift

&nbsp; - Bicep Curl

&nbsp; - Shoulder Press

- Live skeleton camera stream inside the frontend

- Injury risk warnings (rule-based)

- Firebase Firestore integration:

&nbsp; - `postureLogs/latest` for live state

&nbsp; - `postureHistory` for wrong-posture logs with timestamps

- React dashboard with Start/Stop AI Detection

\## 🎥 Demo Flow (for judges)

1\. Start backend server

2\. Start frontend

3\. Open dashboard → click Start AI Detection

4\. Perform an exercise:

&nbsp;  - Correct posture → green

&nbsp;  - Wrong posture → red + issue

5. Click Stop AI Detection

6. Check Firebase Firestore logs for history proof
